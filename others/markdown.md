# Markdown

Markdown is a formatting language used on various websites ( like Reddit, GitHub... )

In fact, this text uses Markdown :D

Mastering Markdown is not only cool, it's useful as fuck as it allows you to write good comments and good documentation on GitHub using a nice formatting. Stop writing ugly READMEs that makes everyone go away at the first look on your doc :)

## Basics

Markdown is a formatting language that compiles into HTML, so you just have to write Markdown and you get HTML in the output.

Because of this, pretty much every Markdown element will be explained using his HTML cousin

### Titles

In markdown you can use different titles, corresponding to HTML `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`

To do that, just write your title like that:
```
# Title
## Smaller title
```

The more `#` you use, the smaller your title will get:
> # # h1
> ## ## h2
> ### ### h3
> #### #### h4
> ##### ##### h5
> ###### ###### h6
