# Rominou Documentation

So basically, it's just some files in which I write documentation about some languages / frameworks. So basically instead of passing 24 hrs a day on the official docs or on StackOverflow I write this shitty doc and when I need to remember some basic syntax I come here, read it and everyone is happy.
